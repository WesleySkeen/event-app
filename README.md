# Event App

A SPA that uses React for the client and .Net core for the server.

## Getting Started

### Running the client

```
cd Event.Client
npm install
npm start
```

## Using the UI filtering and sorting
- Sorting
  - Date : This will sort by the latest date entry in the geometry array on the event object.
  - Status : Sorts by the status (Opened, Closed)
  - Category : Sorts by the category title
- Filtering
  - Date : Filters by the date entries on the geometry objects


## Whats left to do
1. UI
  1. Improve and extend the data that is displayed on the UI
  2. Add paginatation (Events are currently limited to 100)
